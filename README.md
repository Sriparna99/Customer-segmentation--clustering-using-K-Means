# Customer-segmentation--clustering-using-K-Means

Mall customer segmentation using K-Means clustering method
We are going to try to segment customer data we've got from mall. Dataset is small and easy to work with, has no missing values and almost no outliers (will ignore it).

Dataset overview:

Customer ID: Id of customer, this field will be dropped as it's not useful
Gender: customer gender - female / male
Age: age of customer, we've got customers with age from 18 to 70 years
Annual Income: income of customer, will be renamed to income only, values from 13 to 137
Spending Score: Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature, values from 1 to 99
